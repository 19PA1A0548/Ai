# Ai

## Artificial Intelligence:

Artificial Inteligence is the theory and development of machines to perform tasks that require human interventions such as visual perception,speech recognzation,decision making
...(ex : conversion of one language to another by a machine).

## Machine Learning:

Machine Learning is a subset of Ai that helps machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Ml provides us with statistical tools to explore data and draw useful 
insights from it.

## Deep Learning:

Deep Learning is a subset of ML and it is implemented using Neural Networks which are similar to biological neuron. Deep Learning uses deep networks which are nothing but neural networks
with multiple layers.

## Ml process:
1.) Defining objective

2.) Data gathering

3.) Preparing data

4.) Exploring the data

5.) Building a model

6.) Evaluating the model

7.) Predictions
